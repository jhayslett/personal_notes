####Here are some notes from different topics:
  - When exporting html5 you can use Window >> HTML5 Tracker
  - You can customize shapes by right-click >> Convert to Freeform
  - Object Style Manager will assist when building different templates
    - You can even add a transition inside the Object Style Manager
  - When creating a Caption Style you have to create 5 different images for each call out
    - These images have to be in bmp format - no clue why Adobe did that
  - When creating a Caption Style:
    - Use photoshop, some odd reason Illustrator has issues with curved lines
    - Create bitmap images to style you are wanting
      - When designing caption add 3-4 pixels on the outside to distinguish the background color
      - Make the image size the default size you want your caption to be
        - Captions can be blown up but whatever size you want but cannot be shrunk down
    - Create .FCM file that includes the margin and hotspot information
  - When creating a conditional advanced action, there is an else statement at the bottom of the interface to say, "if otherwise"
  - **When recording a screen capture, Captivate does not react to hover events inside of websites**
